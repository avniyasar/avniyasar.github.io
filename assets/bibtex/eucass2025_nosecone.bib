  abstract  = {Reliable prediction of stagnation point heat flux is essential for hypersonic vehicle design, yet high-fidelity simulations remain computationally demanding, limiting rapid design evaluations. This study introduces a surrogate approach utilizing a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode nose cone geometries into a compact latent space, combined with a conditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to estimate stagnation point heat flux. The method accurately predicts heat flux with a significantly reduced subset of the entire design space, greatly reducing computational effort. Additionally, the model maintains accuracy for predictions beyond the original training conditions, offering a practical and efficient alternative to traditional CFD methods.}
