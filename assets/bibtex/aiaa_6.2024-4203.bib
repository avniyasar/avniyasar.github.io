    abstract = { In many engineering applications, determining stagnation point heat flux is essential, especially in the aerospace industry. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have historically been the main instrument for predicting this parameter. Nevertheless, these simulations' computational cost and time may impede their practical implementation especially during pleniminary design phase. This study explores the potential usage of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a novel alternative for efficient prediction of heat flux at stagnation point. As a benchmark scenario, PINNs against conventional CFD simulations are evaluated on an axisymmetric blunt-nosed hypersonic vehicle body with a variable nose radius. The findings show that PINNs considerably increase computational efficiency while achieving accuracy comparable to CFD simulations. }
